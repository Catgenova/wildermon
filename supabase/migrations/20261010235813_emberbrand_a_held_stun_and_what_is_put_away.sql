 *     does not turn tail until it can move, and a fright that lands on one
 *     sends it off when the stun is over rather than through it (`faith_flee`).
 *     The browser froze it outright already (`Creatures.update`).
 *   * What is in a chest, a bin or a crate comes with its rarity, its colour
